# Label propagation for clustering

Label propagation is a heuristic method initially proposed for community detection in networks, while the method can be adopted also for other types of network clustering and partitioning. Among all the approaches and techniques described in this book, label propagation is neither the most accurate nor the most robust method. It is, however, without doubt one of the simplest and fastest clustering methods. Label propagation can be implemented with a few lines of programming code and applied to networks with hundreds of millions of nodes and edges on a standard computer.

## In progress

Development of the algorithm is still in progress. Additional information will be available in the future.
